osna.social
===========

Hi! This repository contains information on [osna.social](https://osna.social), a [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) instance for Osnabr√ºck.

You can find our [terms of service](https://osna.social/terms) in [terms.md](terms.md), [about page](https://osna.social/about/more) in [about.md](about.md) and the custom CSS in [custom.css](custom/custom.css)

The about and terms of service files are saved as Markdown. We convert it to html with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and set it to Mastodon. It's better human readable and easier to change.
